## About Me

I am a data science graduate focused on building **production-style, decision-driven machine learning systems**.  
My work emphasizes **business impact, ROI-aware modeling, and real-world constraints**, not just academic accuracy.
I enjoy translating complex data into **clear insights that support strategic decision-making**.
I have completed Msc in Data Science and Analytics in University of Leeds and have worked with renowned organizations to create solutions that optimize business operations, enhance decision-making, and drive data-driven strategies.
